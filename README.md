# Nilla Orina — personal site

A single-page portfolio for Nilla Orina (Computer Science × Cognitive Science, University of Pennsylvania) with a research focus and a photography gallery.

**Theme — "Emergence."** A living node-and-edge network (neurons / a language network / a constellation) animates behind the hero and threads through the site. The palette runs from a warm amber to a cool cyan — the "signal" gradient — a nod to her research on how meaning is negotiated between people and machines.

No build step, no dependencies. It's plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

```
index.html    structure & copy
styles.css    all styling + the theme
main.js       network animation, scroll reveals, gallery + lightbox
images/       drop your photographs here
```

## Run it locally

Just open `index.html` in a browser. Or serve it (nicer, avoids any file:// quirks):

```bash
cd nilla-orina-site
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

## Add your photographs

1. Put image files in the `images/` folder (e.g. `images/golden-hour.jpg`).
2. Open `main.js` and edit the `PHOTOS` array near the top. For each photo set `src`:

```js
var PHOTOS = [
  { src: "images/golden-hour.jpg", caption: "Golden hour, Schuylkill", size: "tall" },
  { src: "images/portrait.jpg",    caption: "Studio portrait",        size: "" },
  // ...
];
```

- `caption` — shown on hover and in the lightbox.
- `size` — `"tall"`, `"wide"`, or `""` for a normal square. Mix them for a dynamic mosaic.
- Leave `src: ""` to keep the on-theme gradient placeholder for that slot.

Add or remove items freely — the grid and lightbox adjust automatically. Landscape photos look best at ~1600px on the long edge.

## Edit the words

All copy lives directly in `index.html` — find the section (`<!-- ABOUT -->`, `<!-- RESEARCH -->`, etc.) and edit the text.

## Make it yours (colors / fonts)

Open `styles.css` — everything theme-related is in the `:root` block at the top:

```css
--warm: #f4b860;   /* human / synapse */
--cool: #5ad1e3;   /* machine / signal */
```

## Privacy note

By design this site shows only **email + LinkedIn + city** — not the phone number or street address from the résumé. Add them in the Contact section of `index.html` only if you want them public.

## Deploy (free)

**GitHub Pages**
1. Create a repo, push these files.
2. Settings → Pages → deploy from `main`, root folder. Done.

**Netlify / Vercel** — drag the folder onto the dashboard, or connect the repo. No settings needed.

A custom domain (e.g. `nillaorina.com`) can be pointed at any of the above.

## Accessibility

Honors `prefers-reduced-motion` (the network renders a single still frame and reveals turn off), keyboard-navigable lightbox (←/→/Esc), semantic landmarks, and a skip link.
